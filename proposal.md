# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Python on Site Integration

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Through a combination of previous web design (hopefully better than my homepage) and python scripts onto such pages. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

It goes:
Homepage with at least 2 scripts of varying utility/function(still unsure of what utilty or functions). 
For now, GitHub can probably host the webpages but I am unsure of their capabilities.

As neat as doing raw web design is, the site will probably be designed through Dreamweaver simply for ease and time concerns, or I may be forced to use Wordpress or some other site creation tool. Worsecase scenario, I may have to look into creating a temporary webserver which doesn't sound easy and vastly expands the effort.  

For the scripts, they may need need to be converted to JS or using CGI or some other method not found at the time of writing. Possible ideas for scripts include:
	1. Simple turtle.onclick painting thing
	2. Make a sort of calculator
	3. ??? Need to brainstorm for more

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

1. Web pages for each script
2. 2 scripts minimum
3. Each script should have some level of utility or some simple function displayable
4. Simple, but it at least works together

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

1. More streamlined design that sort of looks more modern than a low-res mid 2000s site
2. 3 scripts minimum
3. Each script will have slightly more advanced utility or function ()


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

1. It has modern web design (or at least, looks modern without abusing layers upon layers of obfuscation and tracking): minimalism, 
2. 4 scripts
3. More creative scripts/scripts with more depth (scripts can do more)
4. Passively functional: aka I can upload/host/whatever the site and scripts and it will run on its own w/o my intervention
5. Create a logo (this is a hope because I have little to no art experience)

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to really look into what methods to integrate python into web pages. I have found a few already but I have to consider time and knowledge constraints. Really, the hardest part will be finding a method that works as python on the web doesn't seem very common. Django, CGI, mod_wsgi, others: point is, there are possibly a few methods I need to look at for integration.
In fact, I need to check how different methods work with pages.
The scripts themselves should be based on what we have done previously (worse case it is frankensteined from old scripts). Only new things would probably be GUI and or displaying things through the script, though that may just be displayed on the webpage for each script.

Design-wise, I should look at some modern websites/Wordpress/Weebly etc sites and see what they do. Admittedly, maybe more early 2010's design would be better as minimalism doesn't really interest me.


Overall, I'm not expecting miracles to happen for a beginner coder and web designer.
