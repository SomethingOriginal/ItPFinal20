# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Honestly kind of want to do something web-related. I already have Dreamweaver installed and have done basic CSS/HTML stuff through it (not direct web coding) and am interested in some of the backend if possible, though now that old server shut down I don't know where I'll host it (Github actually can do pages, right? github.io stuff). 
Maybe integrate some python programs into web containers if possible (would hopefully drive me towards some level of optimization though it's not like we're running dialup where every KB counted). Through the CS50x Web crashcourse, 
To do something more unique, I could attempt to design for mobile-only or for an older OS/browser to challenge myself (not very likely) or more likely: 
  just making a small website and integrating relatively simple python scripts into it as little applets (w/o the Java). Using pointer events to draw on small window, a simple guestbook with only one word (max length 7 characters, wouldn't want XXXXXXmy****cat.) 
  
I don't know the full extent of the Web course so I have no clue what its limits are and how much "outside" knowledge is required.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

n/a

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Besides due date, not really at this moment. Some may popup as a result from doing the project.
